                  <h4>Development Desk Help Ticket</h4>
                  <p> 
                    This was a team project. I worked on the front end while my partner created the back end. This app allows users to register a new account. 
                    They can choose a user name and password. A student can then log into the student page and view tickets submitted by others, 
                    tickets that they have submitted, and also create a new help ticket. The helper can also view tickets that have been submitted. 
                    They can also assign tickets to themselves. After they do this, they can view tickets that they have assigned to themselves. They can also 
                    make a ticket as resolved as well as return a ticket to the queue. (User name aaron and password is pass.)  This project demonstrates:
