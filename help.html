      <h4>Immunization Tracker</h4>
      <p> 
        This was my second group project and my first time using React to design components of a much bigger app. 
        My focus was on the doctor homepage. My task was to pull in patient data and displayed a list of patients on the doctor's dashboard. 
        The page has a search bar where the doctor can search for patients by name to find them more easily. 
        Also, the doctor has the ability to click on a patient's 'Records' button to get more information on that patient. 
        After clicking on the 'Records' button, the doctor is taken to the Single Patient page. 
        Here all of the patient's immunization information is listed for the doctor. 
        Also, a button was added that take the doctor to a form that allows them to add a medical record to the database.
        A separate component was created which is an indicator button that changes color depending on whether a patient is due a shot or not.

        On our <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('images/Trello-immunization.jpg');">Trello Board</a>, you can see that I also 
        did work on the introduction page and the footer.

        To login in as a doctor, the email address is provider1@test.com and the password is 1234.

      <ul>
        <li>The use of Styled-Components</li>
        <li>Creating React components that integrate into a larger app</li>
        <li>Filtering through data to conduct a search</li>
        <li>Mapping through data and presenting it to the user</li>
