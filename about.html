                Back in elementary school, I first learned programming 
                language on cutting edge MacIntosh computer.  
                Unfortunately, this is where my computer formal 
                programming learning ended.  However, I did get a 
                Commodore 64 that I would play around with at home.

                Although, I still enjoyed working on my computer, I 
                became fascinated with chemistry in high school. I 
                became a golden bear and eventually graduaded with a 
                degree in chemistry.

                I started working at Encinal High School shortly 
                after graduating from Cal. When I first started, 
                technology was limited to emails and word 
                processing. Over time, technology has become 
                a much bigger part of the classroom. Currently, 
                students can access lessons and assignments 
                electronically. Chromebooks have also become 
                part of the classroom experience.
