                    Our final team project, which lasted for several weeks. We had a team of six working on this task organizer 
                    that included a project manager and two IOS developers. 
                    The rest of us were web developers that were continuing a project that was started by another 
                    team. One of my partners worked on the front-end exclusively while the other worked on the back-end exclusively. 
                    Most of my work was also on the front-end but I also helped out on the back-end. As a team, we created a Notion 
                    document for our 
                    <a href="https://lambdaxarchives.notion.site/Get2It-f99d691af6ce4731b39adc459f35eba9" target="_blank">product board. </a>
                    Part of this work included creating 
                    <a href="https://lambdaxarchives.notion.site/f6289b7ccdf846118fb41efab856b305?v=9d08751813d14eef9f5978b994087ee0" target="_blank">release canvases.</a> 
                    We created versions 1.1 - 1.3 and completed 1.1 and 1.2. 
                    I was assigned to work on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Show/hide password feature on registration and log in pages.</li>
                    <li>Fixing of bugs such as task list rendering</li>
                    <li>Adding categories to tasks</li>
                    <li>Filter tasks by date</li>
                    <li>Testing</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>
                    <br/>
                    On our <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('images/Trello-get2it.jpg');">Trello Board</a> 
                    <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('images/Trello2-get2it.jpg');">(page 2)</a>, you can see that I also 
                    did work on the introduction page and the footer.
