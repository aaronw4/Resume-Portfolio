              This React App makes an API call to retrieve Star Wars data. 
              This data is then passed down to smaller components that render different parts of the page. 
              Character data is displayed in cards on the page. 
              Some of the data displayed (like home planet) requires additional API calls to retrieve. 
              Separate components are designed to collect this additional data. 
              Buttons were also created to change which page of the character list that you are looking at.

              When the submit button is clicked, an API post request sends out the data and receives a response.

            <h4>Immunization Tracker</h4>
            <p> 
              This was my second group project and my first time using React to design components of a much bigger app. 
              My focus was on the doctor homepage. My task was to pull in patient data and displayed a list of patients on the doctor's dashboard. 
              The page has a search bar where the doctor can search for patients by name to find them more easily. 
              Also, the doctor has the ability to click on a patient's 'Records' button to get more information on that patient. 
              After clicking on the 'Records' button, the doctor is taken to the Single Patient page. 
              Here all of the patient's immunization information is listed for the doctor. 
              Also, a button was added that take the doctor to a form that allows them to add a medical record to the database.
              A separate component was created which is an indicator button that changes color depending on whether a patient is due a shot or not.

            <h4>Get2It</h4>
            <p> 
              Our final team project, which lasted for several weeks. We had a team of six working on this task organizer 
              that included a project manager and two IOS developers. 
              The rest of us were web developers that were continuing a project that was started by another 
              team. One of my partners worked on the front-end exclusively while the other worked on the back-end exclusively. 
              Most of my work was also on the front-end but I also helped out on the back-end. As a team, we created a Notion 
              document for our 
              <a href="https://lambdaxarchives.notion.site/Get2It-f99d691af6ce4731b39adc459f35eba9" target="_blank">product board. </a>
              Part of this work included creating 
              <a href="https://lambdaxarchives.notion.site/f6289b7ccdf846118fb41efab856b305?v=9d08751813d14eef9f5978b994087ee0" target="_blank">release canvases.</a> 
              We created versions 1.1 - 1.3 and completed 1.1 and 1.2. 
              I was assigned to work on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Show/hide password feature on registration and log in pages.</li>
              <li>Fixing of bugs such as task list rendering</li>
              <li>Adding categories to tasks</li>
              <li>Filter tasks by date</li>
              <li>Testing</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>
              <br/>

              <a href="JavaScript:newPopup('images/Trello-get2it.jpg');">(page 2)</a>, you can see that I also 
              did work on the introduction page and the footer.
